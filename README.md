# Data-Science Final Project - NLP for NCM Codes classification

## Purpose of this project
When working in supply chain, specifically while importing goods to Brazil, NCM code classification can prove to be a real challenge. The NCM code is the core of the customs clearance process in Mercosul, as it determines the administrative treatment of the corresponding goods (such as the need for import licenses, for example) as well as the taxes applied. 
Customs in Brazil is a very low-trust environment, thus bureaucracy-based. This comes as an unpleasant surprise to many companies exporting to Brazil, and can become a severe burden and bottleneck to the process if the NCM classification subject is not addressed properly. Heavy fines and penalties, including the prohibition to further import and export are applied in case of incorrect declarations.

## The Data
The data used belongs to a specific import project, and it is real data. Therefore, it cannot be shared. This is also the reason why the first file, which contains the data cleaning and preparation, also won't be shared.
